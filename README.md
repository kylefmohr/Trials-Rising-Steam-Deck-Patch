# Trials-Rising-Steam-Deck-Patch
Disabling Easy Anti-Cheat in trialsrising.exe so that the game works on Linux + Steam Deck

### I highly recommend using GE-Proton-9-1 for this game
You can find instructions for how to do this [here](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck)

I tried a ton of different flavors and versions of Proton, and lots of them crash, some of them are capped at 30fps, and the controller doesn't work on others. GE-Proton-9-1 had none of these issues.

If you're struggling to reach 60fps consistently, go to the Trials video settings > advanced> anti-aliasing use CMAA, then go back one menu, and set resolution scaling to .5 or .75.
